# MSDS 460: A Gas Station Simulation

The purpose of this study was to utilize discrete event simulation to model the behavior surrounding a gas station. The scenario is similar fundamentally to the classic coffee shop problem with added layers of complexity. Customers have a varying need for service (gas) based on their randomly generated tank capacity and remaining level of gas. Balking is included to show that customers are only willing to wait if the queue is no greater than 10 minutes. In the initial scenario there was two pumps available for servicing. The addition of fuel pumps was explored to see if the added revenue was worth the installment cost.

Provided is the code for the final simulation project. Balking is included.
